<h1> Champions Leauge</h1>

<h2> Semi Finals </h2>

<h3> Bayern Vs Liverpool </h3>

<p> We predict that Liverpool and Bayern will face each other in the semi finals after blowing past Villareal, and Benfica. It is  also predicted that Bayern will beat Liverpool by a hair as these two giants clash.</p>

<h3> Chelsea Vs Manchester city </h3>

<p> We predict that Chelsea and Manchester City would face each other after barely beating their previous  opponents. Similar to the last time these two teams faced in the Champions leauge final, we predict that Chelsea will win.</p>
